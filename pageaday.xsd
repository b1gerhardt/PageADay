      Page-A-Day Schema for Alexa Skill.
      Holiday handling derived from "Dynamic Holiday Date Calculator by Jay Muntz
      Found at https://www.codeproject.com/articles/11666/dynamic-holiday-date-calculator

      I store and manage my Page-A-Day data in an Excel file. This allows me to print calendars at Kinkos, etc.
      To convert this to an Alexa Skill, I created an XML schema and added some additional fields to my spreadsheet.
      Then, I export the spreadsheet to an XML file for Alexa. This allows me to more easily maintain my data.

      Basic Use:
      Enter a MONTH, DAY and optionally a YEAR for every date and populate the holiday, birthday, quote, etc. fields as you like

      Enhanced Holiday support
      We like to match many quotes to specific events and holidays. Since some holidays move year to year, it is a pain to update
      every year so the quotes match the holiday. With the Alexa skill, I've added the ability to support moving holidays. The
      recommended way to support this is to enter generic quotes for every day of the year. Then, add holiday-specific quotes using
      the enhanced features that support moving holidays. The holiday quote will overwrite the generic quote as needed.

      Enhanced calendar support
      Similarly, some years are more special than others. For example, a 21st Birthday might call for a special quote. To support this,
      use only MONTH and DAY for the "generic" birthday and add a second entry with MONTH, DAY and YEAR for the special birthday. The more specific
      date will overwrite the generic one. NOTE: If multiple people's birthday fall on the same day, be sure to include them in both entries since only 
      the most specific entry will be used.

      Merging records
      The sections are parsed as follows: HOLIDAYS, PAGES, DEFAULT. Pages within each section are parsed in order.
      All matching dates in the HOLIDAYS section are used. Only the first match is used in the other sections so put more specific records ahead of generic ones
      All holiday, birthday and event fields are included in the results. So, if a holiday, normal page and default all have an event, they will all appear
      Only the first quote and author are listed.

      Record types (the TYPE field)
      
      Fixed (optional)         Use for data want on to apply to a specific date. Note that precedence rules allow for the creation of 
                               default data. For example, leaving date field empty gives you a global "default" page that is used as a base
                               for all dates and will be used as-is if there is not a more specific date. Similarly, entering only a month/day/year
                               will give you a default for that month/day/year. Special note: February 29th should be listed as a fixed date if you 
                               want a special quote for leap day (rather than using the SpecificYears type).
                               Blank or missing TYPE fields will be interpreted as Fixed.
                               
      WeekdayOfMonth           These pages occur on a specific day with a specific week within a specific month. SPECIAL and MONTH are required.
                               SPECIAL contains the one based week-of-month, a space, the zero based day-of-week, and optionally an offset.
                               For example, Mother's Day in the US falls on the second Sunday of May. This is encoded as: SPECIAL="2 0" and MONTH="5" 
                               That is, the 2nd (2) Sunday (0) in May (5).
                               Military Spouses Day is two days before Mother's Day. This is encoded as: SPECIAL="2 0 -2" and MONTH="5"
                               
      WeekdayOnOrAfter         These pages occur on the first weekday on or after a specified date. MONTH and DAY are required.
                               For example, Tax Day in the US falls on the first weekday on or after April 15. This is encoded as MONTH=4 and DAY=15
                               
      SpecificYears            These pages occur only on specific years. SPECIAL, MONTH, and DAY are required.
                               For example, Inauguration Day is January 20th following a presidential election. This is encoded as 
                               SPECIAL="1937 4" MONTH="1" DAY="20" That is, starting with 1937, every 4 years on January (1) 20th.
                               This type can also be used for special birthdays, anniversaries, etc. but it is easier to use the Fixed
                               type and enter a fully qualified month/day/year for the special dates.
                               
      LastWeekdayOfMonth       Occurs on the last specific weekday of a specific month. SPECIAL and MONTH are required
                               For example, Memorial Day is the last Monday of May. This is encoded as SPECIAL=1 MONTH=5
                               That is, Monday (zero-based starting with Sunday so 1) of the last full week of May (5).
                               
      ListOfDates              Identifies a specific list dates. Useful for complex holidays. The drawback is the list isn't perpetual.
                               SPECIAL contains a space-separated list of days in YYYY-MM-DD format.
                               
      Ignore                   Use for dates you want ignored. Useful for noting holidays that your group does not observe but that you want 
                               in your data set.
